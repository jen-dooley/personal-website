              <p>
                My name is Jen Dooley. I'm a Frontend Engineer and
                Entrepreneur from Boulder, CO and I have a Computer
                Science engineering degree (B.S.) University of
                Colorado Boulder.
              </p>
              <h2>Languages and Frameworks</h2>
              <p>
                I specialize in the Vue.js ecosystem but I have
                previous experience working Fullstack. I have worked
                with many of the most competitive CSS design
                frameworks such as Vuetify, TailwindCSS and Bootstrap
                4.

                class="max-w-2xl"
              ></skill>
              <p>
                I am always working towards improving my skills and
                learning new things; I recently learned TailwindCSS,
                Typescript and D3.

                web-application services to small businesses, clubs,
                and non-profits. Since then we have worked with
                companies to create marketing websites, analytic
                dashboards, and full CRMs.

                snowboarding, horseback riding, paintball, disk golf,
                and beer league kickball. ðŸ˜Š
